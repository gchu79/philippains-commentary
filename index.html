The book of Philippians is about joy and peace, but it is way more than that. It is about a message that turned the world upside down (Acts 16:20, 17:6). It is both revolutionary and counter-cultural: Christ is greater than Caesar.<br/>2 - Paul's affection for the Philippian church, the first church in Europe that he started, while in prison.<br/>3 - A letter to thank the Philippians, written while in prison again, for their 'partnership' (koinovia) in the gospel, and to encourage and remind them to rejoice in difficult circumstances, persevere (stand firm) in persecution, and love in unity.<br/>4 - As Paul lived to imitate Christ, he exhorted them to imitate him, changing their mind from focusing on earthly things to heavenly things.<br/>5 - The believers were gentiles living in a Roman colony. As we read Philippians, we have to think in terms of Roman culture, Roman word definition and imagery. Paul used words that the belivers were familiar with, but offered a different vernacular and greater definition.<br/><br/>Context: <br/>    When it started, Acts 16, Paul in his second missionary journey;<br/>    His next visit: Acts 20:2-6, Paul in his third missionary journey;<br/>    His present situation: Acts 28:16-30, Paul inprisoned in Rome. <br/><br/>A different slave: Do you understand that no slave in the Roman Empire could be a citizen? Couldn't own anything? Didn't have any rights? Couldn't give testimony to a court of law? Couldn't be defended in court? This is a different kind of slavery. The term is lost in Translation: Servant or Slave: <a href='https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/GTY129/servant-or-slave'>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/GTY129/servant-or-slave</a><br/><br/>Paul positioned himself, as slave to a different Lord, as Christ show His humility by taken the form of a slave.
